## Service Account
A service account is a special kind of account typically used by an application or 
compute workload, such as a Compute Engine instance, rather than a person. 
A service account is identified by its email address, which is unique to the account.

Applications use service accounts to make **authorized API calls** by authenticating as either 
the service account itself, or as Google Workspace or Cloud Identity users through domain-wide 
delegation. When an application authenticates as a service account, it has access to all 
resources that the service account has permission to access. To learn more,
